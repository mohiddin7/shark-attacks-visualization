# Tides of Terror: A Visual Investigation into Shark Attacks Worldwide

## Overview
This project investigates shark attack patterns globally through interactive visualizations. It provides insights into trends, activities that trigger attacks, geographical hotspots, and shark species behind the statistics. The aim is to offer an analytical view of shark-human interactions.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore data through various charts and graphs.
- **Global Data**: Covers worldwide shark attack data, with focus on hotspots like the US and Australia.
- **Activity-Based Analysis**: Looks into which human activities, such as surfing or swimming, are linked to attacks.
- **Species-Specific Data**: Highlights white, tiger, and bull sharks as the most involved species.
- **Historical and Geographical Trends**: Visualizes the impact of media (e.g., *Jaws*) and geographic factors like tourism on attack frequencies.

## Data Sources
- **Shark Research Institute**: Main source of shark attack records.
- **Public Datasets**: Used to map geographic and activity-specific trends.
